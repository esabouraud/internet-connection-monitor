# local internet connection monitor

## Purpose
Monitor local internet connection stability in a straightforward and
lightweight manner. Write to logs when connection changes status.
Optionally keep some metrics around to build some graphs later on.

## TODO
Everything:
  - daemon
  - logs
  - metrics
  - configuration file
  - multiple hosts to try to connect to
  - network protocol to use (ICMP, TCP, HTTP)
